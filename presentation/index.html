# Prerender.io for Episerver

---

## Background

Visitors expect rich web experiences that can only be delivered with sophisticated JavaScript.

But search engine spiders aren't awesome at crawling JS. 

- JavaScript slows them down. 
- They don't always follow XHRs.
- Razor/SSR isn't always feasible (or a silver bullet anyways).

Hundreds of thousands of pages could take days or even weeks to crawl.<br/>
And it could be all wrong. 

**There is uncertainty when launching a new site.**

---

## Background

Prerender (https://prerender.io) is a paid web service that addresses these challenges with little friction: 

1. It accepts a request to a web page via ?query,
2. Renders the page using Google Chrome in headless mode,
3. Caches the result for future requests, and
4. Returns the static HTML and CSS outputs. 

And comes recommended by Google: <br/>
https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/dynamic-rendering

Pages can be seeded using the Prerender web portal by hand or Sitemap.xml.

<br/>
We're dependent on how well the spider handles JavaScript and whether it follows AJAX requests. 

Also, it does too much waiting and thinking...

## With Prerender (before caching)

```
    SPIDER              WEBSITE             PRERENDER

01  ······ GET -------> ··········          ··········  
02  ··········          ······ GET -------> ··········

14  ··········          ·········· <------- 200 ······  
15  ·········· <------- 200 ······          ··········  

    Done
```

<br/>
Very little thinking on the part of the spider.

## With Prerender (after caching)

```
    SPIDER              WEBSITE             PRERENDER

01  ······ GET -------> ··········          ··········
02  ··········          ······ GET -------> ··········
03  ··········          ·········· <------- 200 ······
04  ·········· <------- 200 ······          ··········

    Done
```

<br/>
Prerender immediately sends the cached page back to the website, which forwards
it to the spider.

---

## Middleware

Your website must route incoming requests to Prerender!

<br/>

Official and community [middleware](https://prerender.io/documentation/install-middleware) options exist for speedy integration.

There is an unofficial ASP.NET version:<br/>
[https://github.com/greengerong/Prerender_asp_mvc](https://github.com/greengerong/Prerender_asp_mvc)

<br/>

Episerver requires some additional bootstrapping...
